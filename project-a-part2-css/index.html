                At first nobody recgonized it, all of a sudden it appeared and began to eat up the whole three-dimentional universe, wiping out the universe itself. The creature comes from a higher-dimensional universe, and serves as a loyal soldier to eradicate the lower-dimensional universe in their universe. They love to dormant in these lower dimensions, and once it finished observing, the brutal wipe-out began. The original universe would be brought to their universe as a “printed canvas”.
